  abstract = 	 {Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned.     Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.   }

	training a multilayer neural network with a small central layer to
	reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors. Gradient descent can
	be used for fine-tuning the weights in such "autoencoder" networks,
	but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good
	solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights
	that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes

	to reduce the dimensionality of data.},

abstract = {This paper investigates actual Venture Capital (VC) decision making as it occurs over time in its natural decision environment. Our qualitative analysis is based on a comprehensive, longitudinal data set comprising 11years of archival data from a European-based VC firm. During this time, the VC managed two funds, reviewed a total of 3631 deals, and made 35 investments. By adopting this research methodology, we can overcome several limitations of post-hoc methods and experiments commonly used in this research stream, and also have the opportunity to tackle some fundamental, yet hitherto elusive research topics. For example, our findings reveal how the importance of decision-making criteria varies between different stages of the evaluation process. They also show how VC portfolio composition and VC management time serve as important, yet to-date largely neglected decision-making criteria. Implications for research and practice are outlined.}

@misc{schulman2017proximal,
  abstract = {We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement
learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the
environment, and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function using stochastic
gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient
update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables
multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal
policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy
optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and
have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a
collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari
game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient
methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity,
simplicity, and wall-time.},

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

  month={July},
  abstract={This paper sheds light on the significant role of networks, particularly alumni networks, in venture capital markets. I leverage the instance of a new partner, carrying new alumni networks, entering a venture capital firm as a plausible exogenous adjustment to the VC’s alumni networks. This introduction of new alumni connections prompts an 8.21\% increase in investments of startups founded by alumni. This impact is more pronounced in markets characterized by high risk, or founders who are underrepresented minorities, women, or from less prestigious universities. Conversely, these alumni ties trigger a 22.93\% increase in failure rates, a 17.53\% decline in acquisition rates, and 66.45\% decline in IPO rates. Supplementary tests indicate that despite venture capitalists gaining better information from networks, the inherent preference for alumni startups offsets these advantages, leading to potential capital misallocation.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks and huge language models are becoming omnipresent in natural language applications. As they are known for requiring large amounts of training data, there is a growing body of work to improve the performance in low-resource settings. Motivated by the recent fundamental changes towards neural models and the popular pre-train and fine-tune paradigm, we survey promising approaches for low-resource natural language processing. After a discussion about the different dimensions of data availability, we give a structured overview of methods that enable learning when training data is sparse. This includes mechanisms to create additional labeled data like data augmentation and distant supervision as well as transfer learning settings that reduce the need for target supervision. A goal of our survey is to explain how these methods differ in their requirements as understanding them is essential for choosing a technique suited for a specific low-resource setting. Further key aspects of this work are to highlight open issues and to outline promising directions for future research.},

abstract = {We survey 885 institutional venture capitalists (VCs) at 681 firms to learn how they make decisions. Using the framework in Kaplan and Strömberg (2001), we provide detailed information on VCs’ practices in pre-investment screening (sourcing evaluating and selecting investments), in structuring investments, and in post-investment monitoring and advising. In selecting investments, VCs see the management team as somewhat more important than business-related characteristics such as product or technology although there is meaningful cross-sectional variation across company stage and industry. VCs also attribute the ultimate investment success or failure more to the team than to the business. While deal sourcing, deal selection, and post-investment value-added all contribute to value creation, the VCs rate deal selection as the most important of the three. We compare our results to those for chief financial officers (Graham and Harvey, 2001) and private equity investors (Gompers et al., 2016a).}
